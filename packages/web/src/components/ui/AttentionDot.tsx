/**
 * Canonical attention-dot primitive — the small filled circle with a black
 * border that flags "something here needs your attention" (unread messages,
 * pending notifications, etc.). Separate from `<StatusDot>`, which signals
 * presence/activity (online / typing / thinking).
 *
 * **Size = physical fit, NOT priority** (stdrc 2026-05-14 PR #1709 amend,
 * msg=6ad15567). Unread is a binary signal — every attention dot means the
 * same thing ("there is unread here"); size only varies when the dot's
 * physical context can't accommodate the canonical 10×10. An earlier
 * 3-tier mapping (cross-context vs in-surface vs inline) tried to encode
 * priority into size; it didn't survive contact with consumers — two
 * adjacent "unread" signals visually competing because one was tagged
 * "global" was the symptom that motivated this rewrite.
 *
 * - `lg` (default) = `size-2.5` (10×10) — **canonical** attention dot.
 *   Use everywhere unless the host context is physically too tight.
 * - `sm` = `size-1` (4×4) — **compact-only**. Reach for this only when
 *   the parent surface (badge interior, dense list-row inline marker) can
 *   not visually fit `lg` without crowding. Not a "lower priority" dot.
 *
 * **Why not merge with StatusDot:** the two primitives have different
 * semantics (attention vs presence) and default colors (brutal-pink vs
 * activity-mapped). Merging would force a one-or-the-other-undefined API;
 * splitting keeps each callsite's intent legible at the JSX level.
 *
 * **Border rule:** both tiers keep `border border-black`. The border is
 * what makes the dot read as an "attention chip" rather than a decorative
 * pixel — don't drop it even at `sm`.
